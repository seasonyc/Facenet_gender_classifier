# Facenet_gender_classifier
A gender classifier, transfer learning based on Facenet

I trained this classifier for face translation, but found a trained classifier worked not good, however it has a good performance on classification task, so I keep the code in this repo. 

This repo shares same common resources with my face vae repo, refer that repo to run this code and some specified path in this code need to updated.

There are some test pictures in "test pictures" directory.

gender_classifier.py is not transfer learning, just FYI.
